(Datapath) Tahoe
--------------------------

Required Network Element Configuration:
    *  username <username> privilege 15 password <password>
    *  onep
    *  datapath transport gre sender-id <sender-id> interface <interface>

where 

<sender-id> is a unique 32 bit identifier. This is to distinguish the network 
element from all other elements that may want to connect to the same DPSS application.

<interface> is the interface in which packets will be sent from the
network element to the application.

Set the following environment variables (not required inside the onePK All-in-One VM):

     ONEP_SDK <installed_dir>/onep/c/sdk-c-<version>   

      
Modify dpss.conf:
    (<installed_dir>/onep/c32/sdk-c32-<version>/c/bin/dpss.conf)
    change following:
    LOCAL_IP - to match IP address on which server expects packets
    USER - User that the application should run as
    GROUP - Name of group the app developer belongs to
    TRANSPORT - Transport to use (it is "raw" for IOS)

Run dpss_mp process:
    (<installed_dir>/onep/c32/sdk-c32-<version>/c/bin/dpss_mp_<version>)
    ./dpss_mp -c dpss.conf --fg &
    
To build this application:

    cd src
    make


Configs required for process-hosted application (NXOS):
=================================================

NOTE : DataPath Applications are supported in a process-hosted mode on NXOS.
       Please refer to ADT/container section of User Guide on steps to build your container. 
       After you have built the container with DatapathTutorial binary in it and installed on the device,
       you can run the tutorial from your container as given in "To run this tutorial" section at the end.


Additional configuration will need to be applied to the network element
for packets to be seen by the application:

Required Network Element Configuration:
    *  username <username> privilege 15 password <password>
    *  onep
    *  datapath transport mts


To build this application:

    cd src
    make
    
    Note: You need to put this binary in your container filesystem before you create ova
    
    
Run dpss_mp process:
    dpss_mp should be running in your container, if not, you can start is as follows:
    /usr/sbin/dpss_mp -c /etc/dpss.conf--fg -d all &
    
==========================================================

To run this tutorial:

    bin/tahoe -a <element hostname or address> \
        -i <interface> 
        [-p <protocol>] \
        [-t <transport type>] [-C <client cert file>] \
        [-K <client private key file>] [-R <root certificates file>] \
        [-P <tls pinning file>]

    Where <interface> is the interface on which packets will be sent from the
    network element to the application (eg Ethernet1/2)

    <transport type> can be 1 for TLS transport or 2 for TIPC transport.
    TIPC transport can only be used in process hosted environments.

    The "-C", "-K", and "-R" options are used for TLS transport.
    For more imformation on the use of these options and TLS configuration,
    please refer to the "Getting Started with onePK" document.

    <protocol> is the integer specifying acl protocol
     ONEP_PROTOCOL_ICMP = 1,
     ONEP_PROTOCOL_IGMP = 2,
     ONEP_PROTOCOL_TCP = 6,
     ONEP_PROTOCOL_EGP = 8,
     ONEP_PROTOCOL_IGRP = 9,
     ONEP_PROTOCOL_UDP = 17,
     ONEP_PROTOCOL_RSVP = 46,
     ONEP_PROTOCOL_GRE = 47,
     ONEP_PROTOCOL_ESP = 50,
     ONEP_PROTOCOL_AH = 51,
     ONEP_PROTOCOL_ALL = 256,
